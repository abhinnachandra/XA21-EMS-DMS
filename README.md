Energy Management Systems

Energy Management Systems to meet the challenges of today’s smart grid environment

Electric utilities are faced with many challenges imposed by today’s Smart Grid. High penetration of bulk renewables, demand response options, aging assets and an aging workforce, coupled with increased operating and maintenance costs, security, increased integration with external systems and increased data processing requirements contribute to the needs of today’s advanced Energy Management System (EMS).

The XA/21 EMS meets these demands with a secure core system built on an open-standard, distributed architecture and augmented by powerful application suites for generation, transmission and distribution power grids.

Key Benefits
• Monitors and controls generation, transmission and distribution assests in real-time
• Provides real-time situational awareness coupled with advanced visualization capabilities for faster user recognition of the overall system status
• Analyzes near-term operating grid contingencies and provides alternative solutions to reduce potential outages
• Economically provides increased grid capacity while maintaining overall grid reliability and regulatory requirements
• Reduces overall system support costs through intuitive data and display maintenance support tools
• Meets today’s secure system needs with flexible environments including fully redundant primary and backup production, quality assurance, training and development systems
